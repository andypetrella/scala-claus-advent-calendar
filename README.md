# Scala Claus' Advent Calendar

## What the heck?
### Goal and context
This application is actually a talk, that was initially given at [BruJUG in Belgium/Brussels](http://wiki.brussels-jug.be/doku.php?id=events4:2014_01_session1).

This talk aims to be a gentle, pragmatic and didactic approach of the programming language [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

### Synopsys
The line up is composed of 25 features of the language.
They all share the same property that each be used for our everyday work. 
They are presented in such a way that the next feature enables a cleaner code -- most of the time, more readable.
And, of course, the level increases slightly in order to take the time to catch the concepts intuitivelly. 

### Features
1. JVM and learning curve
2. First code look-a-like
3. Removing noise
4. Cleaning
5. String interpolation
6. Enhance the JDK
7. Inference
8. Function
9. Method
10. Easy immutability
11. Default Parameter
12. Object
13. Class hierarchy
14. Operator
15. List.map
16. List.flatMap
17. Improving readability, take 1, the List
18. $1M mistake
19. Option.map
20. Option.flatMap
21. Improving readability, take 2, the Option
22. Structural meaning
23. Asynchronous tasks
24. Readable and sane asynchronous tasks
25. &not; Explicit

## How to use it
### Requirements
SBT
custom play

### Run
console
~run
Chrome

### The talk
#### Present it, the hard way
go to
start button
the day1 code fails, update the code
save it
If it fails, update again
If it has comilation error, look at the error message, update again
Until the slides is shown
Switch to the result, code, slide
Next slide, repeat until final page

#### God Mode, the soft way
only the slides are coming, by picking the cheat.Day* actions.


#### Shortcuts recap
